# GEMINI.md - Project Context

## Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of templates and documentation for planning and executing technical projects, with a special focus on leveraging AI agents for development tasks. The structure is designed to hold all the necessary documents for a systematic approach to project management, from initial planning to final implementation.

## Key Files

*   `ai_docs/tasks/ai_task_template.md`: This is the core template for breaking down a technical task. It provides a structured framework for defining the task's goals, scope, technical requirements, and implementation plan. This template is intended to be filled out for each new feature, bug fix, or other significant unit of work.

## Usage

The primary purpose of this directory is to provide a standardized set of templates for project planning. To use it, you would typically copy the `ai_task_template.md` file to a new location and fill it out with the specifics of your task. This ensures that all necessary information is captured before development begins, which is especially important when working with AI agents that require clear and unambiguous instructions.
